Y'all, I am **loving** my new role. Today marks one month since I joined [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and started supporting [Community Discussions](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/discussions).

There has been a lot to learn about all the awesome things Vercel is doing. And I know this community is going to keep me on my toes with the wild and interesting things people build!

My own background is in web development and software engineering. I have been professionally building things on the internet for over a decade (and tinkering with Neopets and MySpace long before that ðŸ˜‰).

But there is always more to learn! I even built this new site to better understand [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and try some Vercel features I had never used before. It's a work in progress, but I'm pretty happy with it so far.

I would love to hear about what you're building too! Please come share your projects, questions, and feedback in [Vercel Community Discussions](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/discussions).
